This repository is for saccadic choice task experiments as explained in Crouzet et al. (2010) and Kauffmann et al. (2019).

The first prompt will ask informations to create an EDF file.

The second prompt will ask you for information regarding the subject (age, etc.) and your monitor (refresh rate, size). It is important to fill these in with the correct information, because stimulus presentation time is defined using the refresh rate of the monitor, and stimulus size is defined by the screen size when the observer sits 85 cms away from the screen.

This experiment is designed for two sessions. One in which the stimuli are presented horizontally and the other in which they are displayed vertically. The task is divided in two conditions : one condition for which the targets are human faces (and the distractors are vehicle images) and the other one for which the targets are images containing vehicles (the distractors are human face images). Participants have to make a saccade as fast as possible towards the target image.

If you want to run the experiment without record the eye movements, you have to turn "Dummy_mode" on "TRUE".

This experiment is also designed to work with two additional tasks :
1. https://github.com/MariusGrandjean/Face_Tilt
2. https://github.com/MariusGrandjean/Radial_Bias
